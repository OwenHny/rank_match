# rank_match
 
This is a python script to automate a rank-match process. 

Excel files containing the ranked preference of candidates by employers and the preference of employers by candidates are supplied. The program will match based on the Gale-Shapley algorithm; this produces a maximum matching where no two parties would rather be matched with each other than their supplied matching. Alterations where made to the algorithm so that employers could hire more than 1 candidate.
